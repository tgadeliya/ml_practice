# Word2Vec model 
This repo contains two pytorch models:
- vanilla CBOW model. Implemented from "___" paper
- CBOW + Negative Sampling model. This optimization was proposed in original Word2Vec paper "__". This implementation based on previous vanilla model. Main difference :
  - dataset object return context, target and generated sample based on Unigram distribution to 3/4 power(trick from original paper) 
  - Model outputs loss
